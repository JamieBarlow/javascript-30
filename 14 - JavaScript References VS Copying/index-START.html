    // start with strings, numbers and booleans. These use 'PASS BY VALUE'
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // these examples demonstrate that changing the original value after it has been referenced won't change the value referencing it (age2, name2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);                  // 'PASS BY REFERENCE.' We've updated the original array as well! This is NOT the same as what we did earlier with numbers and strings

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();              // the .slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array and puts into a new array object. Non-destructive
    team2[3] = 'Brad';
    console.log(players, team, team2);          // team2 values should now be different

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in      // .concat() is non-destructive too - merges 2 or more arrays without changing the originals
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww'
    console.log(team3, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);          // this hasn't made a copy, we are passing by reference so changing both at once

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 55 });              // this is similar to [].concat() above, but with objects. You can use the 3rd argument to pass in values
    console.log (person, cap2);             // these are now different

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    console.log (wes, dev);                // the 2 will display different values because 'dev' is a shallow copy of wes, so it's not passing by reference here

    // However:
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes.social, dev.social);  // oh no - these have the same value now. This is because Object.assign produces a shallow copy - only 1 level deep

    // To create a deep copy you can:
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));   // this isn't the most performant method for deep-cloning. Better to look up methods with e.g. Lodash
    dev2.social.twitter = '@different';
    console.log(wes.social, dev2.social);
